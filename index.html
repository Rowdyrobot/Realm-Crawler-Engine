					<p id="play"><b>How to play:</b>
					<p>Explore. Fight. Explore some more. Then more fighting. Lots and lots of fighting. Oh yeah, also try to avoid the traps. Fortunately, there is a lot of treasure. So go get it!
					<p>While how to win the game is something you need to figure out, the general goal of the game is to acquire the most Gold (GLD) in the least amount of Moves (MOV) as you work your way through the many Levels (LVL) of the realm while trying not to die or run away from danger.
					<p>Treasure is acquired by defeating adversaries, searching rooms and summoning Ted. Treasure can be in the form of Armor, Weapons, Magic, Potions or Valuables. Armor, Weapons or Magic automatically replace currently equipped items with lower stats. All treasure (except potions) not equipped are automatically converted to Gold.
					<p>Your character has Strength (STR) to determine hit and misses in battle, Intelligence (INT) to determine magic hits and misses in battle, Perception (PER) to determine search success, Dexterity (DEX) to determine chance of dodging attacks, obstacles and traps and Luck (LCK) to determine probability of spawning adversaries, obstacles, traps and treasure.
					<p>You also have Armor (ARM) for damage resistance, Weapon (WPN) and Magic (MAG) for damage inflicted and Hit Points (HP) for the amount of damage you can take from adversaries and traps.
					<p>Gain Experience Points (XP) along the way in order to increase your character Level (CLV). Level progression increases game difficulty but awards you Ability Points (AP) that you can apply to your character abilities.
					<p>You can explore the realm by exiting rooms [North], [East], [South], [West], [Up], [Down]. Use [Search] to discover hidden treasure and secret doors. [Stuff] views your characters abilities, equipped items and more.
					<p>[Stuff] also allows you to [Heal], [Level Up] and [Summon]. Heal restores HP with healing Potions (POT). When you have the required XP, Level Up appears allowing you to assign AP to your character. Summon hails Ted the Teleporting Merchant to purchase healing potions, armor, weapons and magic  with Gold and has a cool off period of ten (10) turns.
					<p>Exits can be open, blocked, locked or trapped. Move towards an exit to unblock, unlock or disarm. To unblock you can [Shove] the obstacle by using your strength  or [Blast] using your magic if you have a magic item equipped. To unlock you can [Pick] the lock using your dexterity or [Kick] it down using your strength. If the exit is trapped, you can attempt to [Disarm] it using your dexterity or [Ignore] it and move forward anyway using your luck to potentially avoid it.
					<p>A spawned adversary must be dealt with before you may continue. Adversary controls are [Weapon], [Magic], [Combo], [Heal] and [Run!]. Combo deals a powerful strike when Weapon and Magic are both available. Weapon can be used every turn. Magic can be used once every three (3) turns. If death is certain, Run to get away but it is a mad dash through rooms on your current level so you could end up anywhere and your adversary has a small chance to get a final blow in before you flee. Oh yeah, running away also adds moves as a penalty.
					<p>When a room trap spawns, you have a chance to avoid or disarm it based on your DEX and LCK. Otherwise, you will take damage and lose HP.
					<p>Should you run out of Hit Points and subsequently die, you will be revived in a designated room (usually the beginning) on your current level. You will also be given a fraction of your Hit Points and be given penalty moves based on your current level.
					<p>Happy hunting!

					<p><a href="http://realmbuilder.rowdyrobot.com" target="_blank">[Realm Builder]</a> allows anyone to create their own games and stories using the Realm Crawler Engine.
					<p>Your imagination is the limit to where you can go. Create a creepy new dungeon or a space adventure set billions of light years away.
					<p>The Realm Crawler Engine (RCE) is built as simply and agnostic as possible to allow for a wide range of stories to be told. Of course, we will be constantly updating our engine so it continues to meet the needs of our gamers and realm builders.
